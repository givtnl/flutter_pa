Installation instructions Flutter on Windhoos (Assuming you have already installed Android Studio)

// Install flutter
- Get following zip: https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/windows/flutter_windows_2.2.3-stable.zip
- Extract contents of zip into C:\Users\<your-user-name>\Documents
- Under User variables check if there is an entry called Path:
        - If the entry exists, append the full path to flutter\bin using ; as a separator from existing values.
        - If the entry doesnâ€™t exist, create a new user variable named Path with the full path to flutter\bin as its value.

// Install Chocolatey
- Open adminstrative shell (I used Powershell as adminstrator)
        - Run this command: Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

// Install Darts
- Run this command: choco install dart-sdk

// Finalizing setup
- Lets check if we need any other platform dependencies
        - flutter doctor
- You might need to pin point the Android Studio directory for flutter.
        - Run this command: flutter config --android-studio-dir "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio"
- You might need to enable flutter for windows desktop.
        - Run this command: flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
